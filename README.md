Character Tracker

Character Tracker is a Python application designed to help track characters and items for tabletop role-playing games. Currently, I am making it to be used around D&D 5th edition. However once it is done it should be easily adaptable to suit a variety of tabletop games by adjusting the JSON files as needed.

This is a project I had started to make in Java, but then I had started to learn python. In order to learn python I took the concepts I had done in Java and started to see how they are implemented in Python. I have a lot more to learn but this project is definitely helping me become more comfortable in python

At the end of this project I would like to have a functioning app that makes it easy to track players and enemies and dynamically track things like attributes, stats, items, etc.

Usage
Running the Application

To run the application, execute the main.py script:

python main.py

Currently, it runs a multitude of functions to test features and make sure they are all working together

Features

    Character Tracking: Manage player and enemy characters, including attributes and stats.
    Item Management: Track and apply effects of items on characters.
    Dice Rolling: Implement dice rolling functionality for in-game actions.
    JSON Data Handling: Load enemies and items from JSON files for easy customization.
